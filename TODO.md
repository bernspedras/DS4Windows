# TODO

* Add hooks to keep track of active display monitors for Absolute Mouse
* Figure out desired options for Absolute Mouse support
* ~~Change Full Click trigger effect for DualSense. Interpolate and take profile max zone into account (Have a draft that needs more work. Delay implementing for now)~~
* Add more localization ready strings
* ~~Make task related helper GUI app for launching DS4Windows. Might use for other use cases as well. (Poor startup time by comparison)~~
* Add absolute mouse options for various output types (Sticks and Touchpad)
* ~~Include PurgeOldXInput helper app~~
* ~~Look into final DS4Updater check in DS4Updater app. Batch script seems to get launched even when the updater is already up to date~~
* ~~Bundle trimmed ManagedDevcon assembly with PurgeOldXInput. DIFxAPI causing false positivies in VirusTotal.~~
* ~~Determine output behavior for Outer Bind Button. Currently treated as a virtual trigger. Steam treats its version like a normal button (no analog). Might change later.~~
* ~~Test Steam Input Gyro vs Touchpad mouse action priority. (Tested. Output actions are added together. Do not want)~~
* ~~Add Button Wheel sensitivity setting of some kind. (Forget it. Just increase the current time delta used)~~
* ~~Add Max Output Force option for Gyro Mouse-like Joystick~~
* Try to add some form of Action Set support. Really missing playing Mass Effect 1 and 2
